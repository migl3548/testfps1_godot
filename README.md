Following a basic fps in Godot tutorial until I had a camera that could move in the x axis only, and working WASD controls to move the player - 2 hours

Branching off and learning how to build stuff on my own:
- adding y axis controls to the camera - 1 hour
- adding a raycast hitscan shooting to the gun - 2 hours
- creating targets that respawn when shooting them - 2 hours

Gun sprites and learning how to make the base, camera, and movement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjLSpeUBIJU&list=PLpyRatNKRJaq2QMMGk8dGGLyksQxJtX7i
